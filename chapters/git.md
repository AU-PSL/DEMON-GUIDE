# Notes on git

A few years ago, DEMON was hostd on google code and used an svn directory; however, after google code closed shop, we migrated it to github, where it has remained comfortably in the dominion of the AU-PSL group. DEMON is an open-source project whose licence can be found in the LICENSE.TXT file of the main DEMON directory. 

For the purpose of this guide, we assume the reader is familiar with basic version control practices and how to use git on a practical level; however, we also recognize that version control is tricky and requires an understanding of how to collaborate with other users along with a knowledge of the underlying commands. For this reason, we will provide a brief overview of git and github here before continuing further.

### More to come

### Git practices

Though DEMON has had a rather dirty `master` branch in the past, it would be in our best interest to do all future development on a `beta` branch and merge the branch to master once we are sure DEMON is working effectively.
